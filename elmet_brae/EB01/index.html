		<h2>Note. deadline has passed, this project is now in the post production stage for a pre-Christmas release</h2>
		<p>These projects work best with a theme and some guidelines: keep it sparse and abstract, interlude tracks no shorter than 30 seconds, and full tracks no longer than 5 minutes. Theme is "The Land", and the hope is a collection of minimal textures and abstract sounds that'll sequence well together. Deadline for submissions is <strike>24th October</strike> - FIRST OF NOVEMBER</p>
		<p>I'll do some thinking about logistics, distribution (<strike>Bandcamp most likely</strike> - nope!) etc etc</p>
		<p>Email oppen@fastmail.com to contribute, send files in a lossless format hosted somewhere or using some service (file.io, Google Drive, Dropbox, whatever)</p>
		<p>Thanks, Ö</p>
