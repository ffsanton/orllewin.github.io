		<p>These projects work best with a theme and some guidelines: keep it sparse and abstract, interlude tracks no shorter than 30 seconds, and full tracks no longer than 5 minutes. Theme is "The Land", and the hope is a collection of minimal textures and abstract sounds that'll sequence well together. Deadline for submissions is 24th October.</p>
		<p>I'll do some thinking about logistics, distribution (Bandcamp most likely), some informal memorandum of understanding (just consent for me to distribute) etc etc.</p>
		<p>Send a DM if you'd like to contribute or help, ask questions or offer advice, or to get my email address to send media: <a href="https://merveilles.town/@oppen">@oppen@merveilles.town</a></p>
		<p>Thanks, Ö</p>
