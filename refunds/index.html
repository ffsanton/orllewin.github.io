  <article>
    <p>I don't do refunds unless software is non-functional. A product is priced to reflect the complexity and the time/effort required to make it, simple software is cheaper, anything that requires significant time investment to develop is more expensive.</p>
    <p>Don't buy software, usually at the cost of a morning cup of coffee and a pastry, if you can't spare a few dollars/pounds in exchange.</p>
    <p>Orllewin is a side project, if it ever becomes big enough that I think about quitting the day job I'll rethink this policy, but for now the income is too small compared the time investment. Don't treat a small indie like you would a major publisher.</p>
    <p>You pays your money and you takes your chances. Caveat emptor.</p>
