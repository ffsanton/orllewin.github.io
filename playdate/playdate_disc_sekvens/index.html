    <p>Sekvens is a 16 step sequencer/drum machine for <a href="https://play.date">Playdate</a>.</p>

    <p>Features:
      <ul>
        <li>Sequencer grid, each cell has 10 volume steps (0 to 10) and a special stop command (-1). When a cell is highlighted hold B and use up and down to change step volume. Hold down B and press A to toggle the value (if the cell isn't empty it'll clear it, if it is empty it'll set the volume to 10)</li>
        <li>Track mute toggle. Take tracks out of the mix and drop them back in again.</li>
        <li>Effects section with low and high band pass filters and two delays.</li>
        <li>Intuitive controls. B changes values, A moves to the next section. Sections are the main sequencer grid, the central mute section, and effects.</li>
        <li>Load your own samples; a Playdate .pdx file is just a directory, you can replace the .pda files in the Sample directory and update the references in sequencer.json. This is a little technical but there will be full instructions on how to do it here. You can have up to 20 tracks though the ui gets a little squashed with more than 16.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Coming soon in future versions:
      <ul>
        <li>Record your own samples with the built-in mic or a <a href="https://help.play.date/hardware/supported-inputs/">TRRS</a> setup</li>
        <li>If I can it working reliably: PO-Sync to work with Teenage Engineering Pocket Operators.</li>
      </ul>
