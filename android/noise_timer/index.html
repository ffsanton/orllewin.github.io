  <p>Both our children fall asleep to noise every night, the effectiveness of noise as a sleep aid is debated but for our two it's a cue to settle down and stop talking.</p>
  <p>This was a paid app on Google Play but I don't have the patience for the constant admin yak shaving required to keep an app available on there so it's here as a free .apk to side-load instead.</p> 
  <p>When I made this there were no real noise apps available for Android at all, everything was just a badly looped sample, so I set out to figure out how to generate white/pink/brown noise properly on Android and this was the result.</p>
  <p>Download via your Android browser, ignore the theatrical side-loading warnings from the OS: <a href="./noise_timer_1_0_3.apk">noise_timer_1_0_3.apk</a></p>
