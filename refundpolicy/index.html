    <p><b>Gogledd Orllewin</b><br>software refunds</p>
  </header>

    <ul>
      <li>I don't do refunds unless software is non-functional. A product is priced to reflect the complexity and the time/effort required to make it, simple software is cheaper, anything that requires significant time investment to develop is more expensive.</li>
      <li>This website and my YouTube channel has multiple examples of all titles, they give a good indication of the experience/features ahead of purchasing.</li>
      <li>The idea of a software refund for software that works but doesn't meet some arbitrary expectations is for the likes of Sony and Microsoft, not small indie developers.</li>
      <li>My software doesn't have DRM or any online authentication, this means once you have the binary you can't meaningfully return it, if I refund you you have the software for free - whether you're happy with it or not. Caveat Emptor.</li>
      <li>Don't expect software built by a sole developer in their precious spare time to have the same level of polish as the output from a full-time studio with multiple employees.</li>
      <li>Don't buy software, usually at the cost of a morning cup of coffee and a pastry, if you can't spare a few dollars/pounds in exchange.</li>
    </ul>
