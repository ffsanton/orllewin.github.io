<h1>Coracle for Playdate - Learning Lua</h1>
<img class="playdate_image" src="images/playdate_test_card_colour.png"><br>
Coracle for Lua has so far been developed without properly learning how Lua works by hacking things together as best I can. Hopefully it's not too terrible but Lua is a strange language and there are some things I really need to get a full understanding of if I plan to work with it for any length of time.
<h2>No OO</h2>
Lua doesn't have an explicit object orientated class structure like most high-level languages, but you can approximate it with some difficulty. Pretty much everything else in the language behaves with few surprises, but field scope/object references are definitely quirky and it's here where I'll focus my learning - what even is a metatable?
<h2>Variable Scope</h2>
A quick note on scope: you can define a variable <b>anywhere</b> and it'll be visible <b>everywhere</b>:
<pre><code>
-- visible everywhere:
a = 10

function hello()
    -- also visible everywhere:
    b = 20
end
</code></pre>
<br>
The <code>local</code> keyword limits field visibility to the current block:
<pre><code>
-- visible everywhere:
a = 10

function hello()
    -- scope limited to hello():
    local b = 20
end
    </code></pre>
</pre>
<h2>Tables</h2>
Tables are Lua's defining characteristic. The official documention: <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/2.5.html">2.5 – Tables</a> and <a href="https://www.lua.org/pil/3.6.html">3.6 – Table Constructors</a>
